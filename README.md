# ConfEager
ConfEager is a configuration library for Java, designed to be as simple and lightweight as possible, to allow easy integration, and to maximaze dynamic capabilities.

ConfEager data is eagerly loaded, hence it's name, making your configuration super fast and up-to-date at runtime, since everything is loaded on startup, and is stored in memory.

ConfEager library is designed to be easily extended and customized to enable working with whatever technologies you like to use to store configuration. It provides very little out-of-the-box library support, thus it has no dependencies, and it adds tiny footprint to your project.
